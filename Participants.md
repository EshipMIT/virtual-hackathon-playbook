### Participants


#### Applications

We recommend requesting applications for people who wish to participate. You might not review every application, but the effort put into an application in terms of length is a good indicator that potential participants are passionate about participating. It is a good idea to ask applicants how much time they can commit during the weekend _and_ after the weekend to implement the solution so that you can ensure the pool of participants is as dedicated as possible.


#### Size/Capacity

Virtual hackathons tend to gather more interest since they can be open to the entire world. While you may wish to welcome anybody and everybody you must keep in mind the challenges of scaling a virtual hackathon with the number of organizers required to support additional participants.


#### Team Formation

Team formation is difficult in person and it is even harder online but we have developed a process that works well to ensure that teams are built of individuals who are passionate about the problem theyâ€™re solving and represent a well-balanced skill set.

To form teams we recommend breaking off individuals from the larger participant pool (if the size of the hackathon requires) into smaller groups focused on broad problems. Each group should join one Zoom meeting or webinar hosted by a member of the organizing team. If the hackathon is small enough (&lt;200 people) then this may be a single Zoom meeting or room.

The host should introduce the problem that participants will be solving and explain the flow of team formation. Each participant who has an idea that they would like to pitch should raise their hand in the web conference. The host calls on people to unmute their microphone and they are given 90 seconds to pitch their idea and mention the Slack channel where they will be working on it. After pitching the individual can submit their Slack channel to a Google Form, which populates into a spreadsheet for the participants listening to reference. Those participants who are not pitching their own idea can choose to join those pitching in their Slack channels.
