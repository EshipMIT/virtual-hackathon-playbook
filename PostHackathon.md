### Post-Hackathon

As the hackathon comes to an end it is of the utmost important to leave participants with next steps so that they can continue working to develop and implement their solutions. The first piece of post-hackathon support for participants is direct written feedback from the judges. Teams thrive on this feedback and it is very important that they receive it as a takeaway. We also recommend referring them to resources that they can leverage in continuing to develop their solutions. Amongst those resources are mentoring from the mentors that the teams connected with already in addition to those who may have been working with other teams. In order to facilitate this, a mentor directory is helpful. Lastly, and possibly most meaningful, is connecting teams with partner organizations. Since the partner organizations have such a strong influence on the definition of the problems/prompts they should be put in contact with the teams to ensure that partners have the opportunity to work with teams to refine and implement solutions in the real world.
