## FAQs

Most commonly asked questions by new organizers:


### How long will it take to plan/prepare for the virtual hackathon?

Depends on the number of participants. We ran a weekend IDEAthon with 100 participants with just 2 days of planning. If youâ€™re looking to include more participants and partners then you should ensure that you have a few weeks to organize and market the event.


### How many people do I need to organize the hackathon?

We recommend a core team of no more than 5 individuals. Beyond that you will need organizers to help with team-specific coordination. We recommend having at least 2 coordinators for every 250 participants.


### How much does it cost to run a virtual hackathon?

We ran a 1,500 participant hackathon with roughly $200. Note that this does not include prize money so if you decide to award monetary prizes you will need to fund those as well.
