### Marketing

It is important to get the word out far and wide. It starts with a simple one-page document that describes the goal of the hackathon, date, and time. This is a piece of collateral that is useful for sharing with potential partners to get them on board. One of the major benefits that partners bring is the ability to push out marketing for the event so it is important to empower them with other marketing materials including sample tweets, email blasts, and social media friendly graphics in a media guide.
