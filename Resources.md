### Hackathon Resources

In order to ensure that participants are successful through the course of the weekend we recommend organizing resources for them to leverage in developing their solutions. We think of resources as being organized into categories including mentorship, education, tools, and technical resources.


#### Mentorship

Mentors should be curated and organized by skill set/background to ensure that participants can leverage experts in any area during the hackathon.


#### Education

In order to ensure that the solutions developed are high quality we recommend providing teams with access to one or two workshops over the course of the hackathon. We shared a “How to Pitch” workshop and you might find it helpful to include an additional workshop on something specific to the hackathon prompt. We don’t recommend more than two because it takes away from the time that participants have to work.


#### Tools

We recommend curating a list of tools that will be helpful to participants in the virtual hackathon. These include links to online video conferencing solutions, digital whiteboards, graphics resources for final presentations, and virtual collaboration tools (Zoom, Slack, Miro, etc). In addition, if possible, you should provide cloud credits from a cloud infrastructure provider to teams to host their solutions.


#### Data Sets

In order to support the teams in their development of solutions we recommend curating data sets from partners and other third parties. For example, for the MIT COVID-19 Challenge we provided access to EHR data systems and pandemic data from the WHO and Johns Hopkins.
