### Partnerships

Partners can support in many ways: funding, marketing, problem definition, mentorship, and judging. Different partners may serve different purposes but every partner should directly contribute to the success of the event in some way.

Partners should help define the problems presented to the participants as they are best equipped to describe the real-world challenges faced on the ground and can work with winning teams to implement solutions post-hackathon. Since your partners will be working with teams afterwards we recommend that individuals from these organizations be involved in mentoring and judging to ensure that the end solutions are as valuable as possible.
