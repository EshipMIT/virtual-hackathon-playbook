### Communications

There are a few different forms of communications that must be carefully organized to ensure that the right people have access to relevant information over the course of the weekend:

#### Website

A website should be put together to provide information to the public including the dates/times, the goal of the hackathon, problem areas, partner organizations, FAQs, and links to register or volunteer to support.


#### Guides

In order to keep everyone on the same page and informed we recommend creating separate “Guides” for each group of individuals involved in the hackathon. You should have a guide for organizers, participants, partners, mentors, and judges that is the source of truth of information. There should also be a post-hackathon guide with contact information and resources that remain available.


#### Emails

Email communications should be written to ensure that all involved including organizers, participants, mentors, judges, and partners have the information they need exactly when they need it. These should cover necessary information before, during, and after the hackathon event.
