## What is a virtual hackathon?

A hackathon where all team interactions take place via digital collaboration tools. Running a virtual hackathon has many benefits over an in-person hackathon. First, it allows for more participants to work remotely. More participants means more people working to solve specific challenges and more diverse backgrounds represented from different countries, cultures, and expertise.


## What’s the goal of a hackathon?

Different hackathons have different goals – some short lived and some with lasting impact. Consider whether you are trying to solve a technical problem in the short term, or a business or societal problem long term. It’s important to start here because the design of the hackathon and people involved change depending on your desired outcomes. Once the goal of the challenge has been determined it is necessary to bring in the relevant partners to determine the problems, or prompts, that participants will be working on over the course of the hackathon.

Here’s the process:

1. Define the goal
2. Identify key partners
3. Define prompt(s) to focus on
4. Select dates of the event
5. Create marketing materials
6. Recruit more partners
7. Promote event to target participants
8. Select and invite participants, mentors and judges
9. Host event
    1. Day 1: kick-off + team formation
    2. Day 2: hacking + mentorship + support (e.g. practice pitches)
    3. Day 3: mentorship + final pitches + next steps
10. Identify winning + continuing teams
11. Provide post-hackathon support
