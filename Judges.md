### Judges

Judges should come into the final day of the hackathon with an orientation about the prompts, judging criteria, and process for judging. Each judge should be prepared to listen to each presentation, provide live feedback, and submit their review of the presentation. We recommend 3-minute pitches from participants with 2 minutes of feedback and any necessary Q&A. When each presentation finishes, judges should submit a Google Form with written feedback for the team to see as well as quantitative ratings of each part of the judging criteria. The Google Form will populate into a Google Spreadsheet where a pivot table should be setup to provide automatically calculated average ratings for each team overall. The automatically generated pivot table allows the judges to deliberate and choose a winner much quicker after each team is finished presenting.
