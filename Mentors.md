### Mentors

During the hackathon it is likely that participants will significantly benefit from the guidance and advice of mentors who can help them flesh out their ideas, provide feedback on their solutions, and assist from a technical perspective. Having a good balance of mentors is important and we recommend including at least one mentor from each partner organization in addition to other relevant subject matter experts.

Over the course of the weekend participants should be able to submit a request for a mentor with a specific need. Mentors should be able to field these requests and join the requesting team in their Slack channel. Mentors may also be asked to join for pitch practice to provide teams with feedback as they continue to refine their pitch in preparation for judging.
