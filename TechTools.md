### Technology & Tools

When running a virtual hackathon there is a need to leverage technology to facilitate all parties involved. It is also important to consider whether the tools youâ€™re using will support participants in areas where internet access is limited and you may need to explore alternatives. We recommend using a combination of tools including:


#### Slack

The Slack collaboration tool provides centralized communication for organizers, participants, mentors, partners, and judges. We strongly recommend setting up an announcement only channel in Slack so that only the organizers or Slack admins can post messages. This allows participants to get one stream of information that is relevant to them. We also recommend creating separate channels dedicated to each prompt/problem and each partner for specific questions.


#### Zoom

We recommend using Zoom or a similar web conferencing tool for audio and video communication. Each meeting that involves all parties should be hosted as a webinar, which allows only those designated to speak, share video, and share their computer screen. Examples of these would be the [LINK] Opening Ceremony, Closing Ceremony, Judging, and any workshops throughout the weekend. During the weekend, teams can make use of their own Zoom accounts.


#### Google Slides

Using Google Slides for presentations and guides allows everyone to see the published presentations and allows any of the organizers to quickly edit content without any tool-specific knowledge required. We recommend keeping a Google Drive folder for organizers to edit files and for others to have view-only access.


#### Google Forms / Spreadsheets

Depending on the size of your hackathon, Google Forms can be a very powerful tool for information collection. You can leverage Google Forms to collect participant applications, team registrations, final presentation submissions, and more. However, if your hackathon has a large number of participants you may wish to consider a platform that can handle a greater number of individuals.

#### Airtable
For larger and on-going events, centralizing information is key. Tools like Airtable can help organizing teams streamline workflows, handle task management, and easily ingest and organize datasets from Google Drive and other sources. Its flexibility and intuitive and user-friendly interface makes implementation quick and easy.

#### Hackathon Platform

You may wish to consider a hackathon platform like DevPost to collect information about participants, teams, and submissions if you are running a larger virtual hackathon since they are built to support a lot of users unlike a simple Google Form.
